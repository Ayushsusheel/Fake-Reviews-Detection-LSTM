# Fake-Reviews-Detection-LSTM
  

Abstract :

The growing volume of fake reviews undermines consumer trust and distorts product evaluations on e-commerce platforms. Current detection techniques often depend on single features or require extensive, quickly outdated manually labelled datasets, rendering traditional classifiers like logistic regression and Support Vector Machine less effective against dynamic spamming strategies. To address this, we propose a lightweight Long Short-Term Memory-based framework that models sequential word patterns and integrates contextual cues by combining category labels, star ratings, and review text into a single cleaned sequence. This integrated sequence is processed by a compact neural network comprising an embedding layer, a Long Short Term Memory encoder to learn intricate dependencies and a simple classification layer. This proposed study achieved a peak accuracy of 95.54%, demonstrating superior performance over traditional methods and highlighting the effectiveness of sequence-sensitive modelling for fake review detection.
